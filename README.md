### Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create a Docker Network

Before deploying the frontend, you need to create a specific network for the project. This will allow the containers to 
communicate with each other.

```bash
docker network create shared_network
```

### Step 2: Build and Start the API
To build the Docker image and start the containers, follow the steps below:

From the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located, run the following command to build the images and bring
up the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment
Once the containers are running, you can verify the status of the services with the following command:
```bash
docker ps
```
